## What is it?
Just a weird third person single player shoooter that I am making from scratch to learn just about every aspect of Unreal Engine from a C++ perspective. Animations, HUDs, Line Tracing, Movement, Weapons, Enemy AI, Character Design, Level Design and much more. I thought I'd make it public on GitHub because, why not?

## Current stage of development:
- LTBelica implemented with idle/walking/jogging/shooting/zooming animations. Crosshair HUD, Line tracing on gun firing, Zoom camera FOV interpolation. Keyboard/Mouse & Controller controls.

## How to get the repo working:
- Requires Git LFS
- Unreal Engine 4.27
- Some IDE setup to UE4.27 standards to compile
- Assets from the marketplace added to the project (see assets list below)

## Assets required:
Certain marketplace assets are added to the .gitignore to save on repo space, they must be added to the project for it to function correctly.
